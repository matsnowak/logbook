# H1 Managing your SDK
--------------
There is always a problem with upgrading your dev tools and SDKs. You need to uninstall and install newest version because you could have a conflicts. You need to add their location to PATH.

Use SDKMAN
http://sdkman.io/usage.html

Just type
`skd install java`


# H3 Java generics: `<? super T>` vs `<? extends T>`

Use a rule *PECS*.  Producer extends, Consumer super

You can consume(read) every type added to list as Number
```
public void printNumbers(List<? extends Number> list) {
   for (Number number : list) {
        System.out.print(number);
        System.out.print(", ");
    }
}
```


You can produce (add to list) every suptype of `Number` class
```
public void fillNumbers(List<? super Number> list) {
    Number n = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    list.add(n);
    list.add(3);
}
```
