#H1 Should REST API starts from `/api/v1/user/{userid}/resource` or `/api/v1/resource`?
--------------
Containing user identifiers in api url is generaly bad practice. If you do not have to refer to another user resources *public* api should not conatis user identifiers.
Use user ids in internal microservices api, because is obvious and easy to use. 
Do not use in public api gateway, just extract user for its authorization/credentials/session.
